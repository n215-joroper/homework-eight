                    <p>The Forbidden Forest was an ominous wooded area, situated on the edges of Hogwarts but out-of-bound to its students. Full of magical creatures and beings, including unicorns, Acromantula, Thestrals and centaurs, the forest was known as a dangerous place for all - except perhaps Hagrid.
